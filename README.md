## Indexed ImageFolder 

An alternative `ImageFolder` that returns the image index instead of the class index. This could be useful in problems where the images in a given class need to have individual indices as opposed to a single class index. `IndexedImageFolder` can be used in the same way as `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`.
